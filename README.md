# BioinformaticsProject
Project for CS116: Bioinformatics

This project was a group project run throughout the semester for CS116: Bioinformatics. In my group, I did the vast majority of the programming, which can be found in the ipynb file. In this project, our group was assigned an unknown DNA sequence, found in the fasta file, and we were given various tasks that involved analyzing this file. This included finding potential open reading frames, finding the amino acid sequences, and finally mapping out our findings.
